<h1>Free Basic Vital Signs Chart for home use</h1>
<p>Hosted for free with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> after discovering sites were charging money to download potentially life saving forms like this!</p>
<p>If you are looking after somebody (or even yourself) who is suspected of being infected with Corona Virus (COVID-19) at home, then keeping a record of their vital signs is a really useful thing to do</p>
<p>It will give you a reliable way to recognise changing trends in the patient and will be very helpful to health care professionals in understanding the patient's history should you later present at a hospital or doctor's surgery, or interact via telephone or electronic means.</p>
<h2>Download and Print</h2>
<p>You can <a href="COVID-19-patient-record-form.pdf">download this Free COVID-19 Patient Record Form</a> by clicking on the link. It is a PDF file which should be easy to print on most home computers.</p>
